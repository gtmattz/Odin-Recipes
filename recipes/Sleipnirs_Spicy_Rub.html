    <img src="../images/sleipnir_rub.jpg">
    <h2>A spicy ride on Odins stalwart steed!</h2>
    <p>A tasty rub for smoking a large piece of meat.  Made with 8 easy to find ingredients, this is a perfect choice for smoking a pork butt (aka. shoulder or picnic roast) for pulling, but can be used any place a spicy dry rub is needed.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Salt:</strong>  As much as you need to properly season your butt, too much makes everything taste bad and is unhealthy, so be careful!</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Cracked Black Pepper:</strong> 2 teaspoons, or as much as you can handle/prefer, it needs to be peppery...</li>
        <li><strong>Smoked Paprika:</strong>2 teaspoons.  Doesn't strictly have to be smoked, but definitely Do not skip this, or you will regret it!</li>
        <li><strong>Cayenne Pepper:</strong> 2 teaspoons.  Some guy on the TV told me to say 'BAM!' here then add 2 teaspoons more, this is optional.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion Powder:</strong>2 teaspoons.  Because it tastes good?</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Powder:</strong>2 tablespoons. For you Health and to keep the Vampires away.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown Sugar:</strong>1/4 cup. It may sound like alot, but trust me, it is ok.</li>
        <li><strong>Fresh Ground Coffee:</strong>1/2 to 1 teaspoon.  I know this sounds weird, but it is the secret ingredient that makes everything amazing.  Make sure to grind it nice and fine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <p><ol>
        <li>In a medium size bowl, combine all ingredients</li>
        <li>Mix well until fully incorporated. I find a fork or a small wire whisk to work adequately.</li>
        <li>Evenly spread over entire surface of your piece of meat. <em>optional: before applying rub, thinly coat meat with your favorite mustard.</em></li>
        <li>Cook your meat!  This is a rub recipe, not a meat smoking tutorial, I am sure you can figure it out!</li>
    </ol> </p>
    <p>
        This rub can also be used as a seasoning for most any meat, and can be changed to your taste, be adventurous!
