# Odin-Recipes
Some kind of "Recipe Book" situation going on here I guess...

This is going to be a list of recipes or something.

By the end of this thing I will have demonstrated my ability to use some basic html stuff like formatting and adding images and links and whatnot.

Maybe I will try to embellish it a little, IDK, depends on how I feel when I get to the end of the lesson.
